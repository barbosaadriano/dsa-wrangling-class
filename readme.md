# Hash Game

The Hash Game is a console-based game where two players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their own mark (either 'X' or 'O').

## How to Play

1. Run the game code in an R environment or console.
2. The game will display an empty 3x3 grid, numbered from 1 to 9.
3. Players take turns making moves by entering a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the position they want to mark.
4. The first player will use 'X', and the second player (computer) will use 'O'.
5. After each move, the updated grid will be displayed.
6. The game continues until one player forms a line of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the grid is full, resulting in a draw.
7. If a player wins, the game will display a victory message.
8. If the game ends in a draw, a draw message will be shown.

Have fun playing the Hash Game!
