# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game! This simple console-based game will challenge you to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## How to Play

1. Run the R script `guessing_game.R`.
2. You will be presented with a welcome message and informed that a number between 1 and 100 has been chosen for you to guess.
3. Enter your guess when prompted, making sure it falls within the range of 1 to 100.
4. The game will provide feedback on your guess. If your guess is too low, it will notify you to try a higher number. If your guess is too high, it will notify you to try a lower number.
5. Continue guessing until you find the correct number. When you guess the correct number, the game will congratulate you and display the number of attempts you made.
6. The game will then end.
