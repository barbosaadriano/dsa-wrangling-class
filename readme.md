# Version Control with Git in R

Welcome to the **Version Control with Git in R** project! This project aims to demonstrate the fundamentals of version control using Git within the R programming language.

## Overview

Version control is a crucial aspect of software development that allows you to track and manage changes to your codebase over time. Git, a widely used version control system, provides a robust framework for collaboration, code sharing, and project management.

In this project, we explore the basic concepts and workflow of version control using Git through an interactive R script. The script showcases the usage of Git commands to create and initialize a repository, add files, make changes, create branches, merge branches, and more. The accompanying console output provides step-by-step explanations of each command, making it easy to follow along and understand.

## Repository Contents

- `Exemplo.R`: The R script that demonstrates the usage of Git commands for version control in R.

## Getting Started

To run the code and explore the Git commands, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command: `git clone <https://github.com/barbosaadriano/dsa-wrangling-class.git> version-control-with-git-in-r`.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd version-control-with-git-in-r`.
4. Run the R script: `Rscript Exemplo.R`.
5. Observe the console output to understand the concepts and commands used in Git version control.

Feel free to modify the script or experiment with different Git commands to further explore version control in R.
